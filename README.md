## Introduction
When we first started with PGP keys the terminal interface was good enough. But during the last month we starting using subkeys with PGP. Using the terminal interface and remember all commands in order to update short-living subkeys is just a pain. Thus we decided to write an own tool providing the user with a workflow to create or renew subkeys for a given master key.
