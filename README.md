## Introduction
When we first started with PGP keys the terminal interface was good enough. But during the last month we started using subkeys with PGP. Sitting in a terminal interface and remember all commands in order to update short-living subkeys is just a pain. Thus we decided to write an own tool providing the user with a workflow to create or renew subkeys for a given master key.
